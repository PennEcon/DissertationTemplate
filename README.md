# Penn dissertation template

This is a template for a Penn Economics/Finance/AppliedEcon style dissertation. See the example document with placeholder text [here](https://pennecon.github.io/DissertationTemplate/dissertation.pdf).

The main file is `dissertation.tex`. Add custom packages and formatting to the preamble. 

Front matter (the abstract, copyright notice, dedication, and acknowledgements), are in the folder `frontmatter`, and should be modified appropriately or removed if necessary.

Include your paper contents (excluding the preamble, of course), where `chapterX.tex` is currently, replacing `\input{content/chapter1.tex}` with your own work.

If you're interested in more thorough automation and/or writing your dissertation with `knitr`, see @MichaelChirico's fork [here](https://github.com/MichaelChirico/DissertationTemplate).

Check the [university's style guidelines](http://guides.library.upenn.edu/dissertation_manual/formatting) to adjust for changes.
