The Abstract is a condensed summary of the dissertation, not to exceed 350 words. All words count towards the total. The abstract, which is normally a single paragraph, consists of four parts: the statement of the problem; the procedure and methods used to investigate the problem; the results of the investigation; and the conclusions.

The abstract is published online by ProQuest in “Dissertation Abstracts International,” providing information to interested readers about the general content of the dissertation.

The abstract is double-spaced. Below the word "ABSTRACT" (in upper case), list the title of the dissertation (upper case), your name, and your dissertation supervisor's name. If you have both a supervisor and co-supervisor, list the co-supervisor’s name on the line beneath the supervisor’s. Do not include any titles (e.g. “Supervisor” or “Advisor”), as this is indicated by the placement of the names.
